In our presentation, we examined employee well-being, focusing on mental, physical, and work-life balance aspects. We found that moderate daily stress is common, and strategies like meditation and physical activity are beneficial. A balanced diet, optimal sleep, and robust social networks significantly enhance productivity and satisfaction. Our analysis suggested that factors beyond traditional health metrics, such as emotional expression and personal passions, critically impact well-being. We recommended strategies like promoting vacation usage, healthy eating, and personal development programs to improve overall employee well-being.
